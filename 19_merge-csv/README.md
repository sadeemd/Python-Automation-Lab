# Day 19 — Merge Multiple CSV Reports (multi_reports → merged.csv)

## Overview
This lab merges multiple CSV files (with the same columns) into one combined CSV file.

You will place several CSV reports inside the `multi_reports/` folder, then run `merge_csv.py`.
The script will read all `*.csv` files, combine their rows, and generate a final file: `merged.csv`.
