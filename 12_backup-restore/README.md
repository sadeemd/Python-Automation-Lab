# Day 12 - Backup Before Editing (Safety)

This mini project demonstrates a very important concept in automation and IT work:

✅ Backup the original file **before making any edits** (Safety First)

## Why This Matters

When you edit a file directly, you may:

- lose important content
- make a mistake and not be able to recover
- overwrite data permanently

So the best practice is:

✅ Create a backup copy first  
✅ Then edit the original safely
