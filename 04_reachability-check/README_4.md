# Day 4 — Reachability (Resolve Only)

This lab checks **DNS resolution** (not real ping).  
It tries to resolve each host in `hosts.txt` using `socket.gethostbyname()` and writes a quick report.

## Files
- `hosts.txt` — targets (one per line)
- `ping_like.py` — script
- `reach_report.csv` — output report

## Run
```bash
python ping_like.py
