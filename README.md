# Python-Automation-Lab

This repository is my automation lab: small Python scripts that produce practical outputs (logs/reports).
Level: Beginner → Intermediate (learning by building).

## Structure
Each folder contains one small tool:
- `01_dns-check/`
- `02_port-check/`
- `03_http-check/`
(And more…)

## How to run
1) Open a tool folder
2) Read its README
3) Run:
```bash
python script.py
